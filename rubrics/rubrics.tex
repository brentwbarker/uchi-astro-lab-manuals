		\toprule
		& Scientific Ability
		& Missing & Inadequate & Needs Improvement & Adequate \\ \midrule \endhead
		B1
		& Is able to identify the phenomenon to be investigated
		& No phenomenon is mentioned
		& The description of the phenomenon to be investigated is confusing, or it is not the phenomenon of interest.
		& \midsloppy The description of the phenomenon is vague or incomplete.
		& The phenomenon to be investigated is clearly stated. \\ \midrule
		B2
		& Is able to design a reliable experiment that investigates the phenomenon
		& The experiment does not investigate the phenomenon.
		& The experiment may not yield any interesting patterns.
		& Some important aspects of the phenomenon will not be observable.
		& The experiment might yield interesting patterns relevant to the investigation of the phenomenon. \\ \midrule
		B3
		& Is able to decide what physical quantities are to be measured and identify independent and dependent variables
		& The physical quantities are irrelevant.
		& Only some of physical quantities are relevant.
		& The physical quantities are relevant. However, independent and dependent variables are not identified.
		& The physical quantities are relevant and independent and dependent variables are identified. \\ \midrule
		B4
		& Is able to describe how to use available equipment to make measurements
		& At least one of the chosen measurements cannot be made with the available equipment.
		& All chosen measurements can be made, but no details are given about how it is done.
		& All chosen measurements can be made, but the details of how it is done are vague or incomplete.
		& All chosen measurements can be made and all details of how it is done are clearly provided. \\ \midrule
		B5
		& Is able to describe what is observed without trying to explain, both in words and by means of a picture of the experimental setup.
		& No description is mentioned.
		& A description is incomplete. No labeled sketch is present. Or, observations are adjusted to fit expectations.
		& A description is complete, but mixed up with explanations or pattern. Or the sketch is present but is difficult to understand.
		& Clearly describes what happens in the experiments both verbally and with a sketch. Provides other representations when necessary (tables and graphs). \\ \midrule
		B6
		& Is able to identify the shortcomings in an experiment and suggest improvements
		& No attempt is made to identify any shortcomings of the experiment.
		& The shortcomings are described vaguely and no suggestions for improvement are made.
		& Not all aspects of the design are considered in terms of shortcomings or improvements.
		& All major shortcomings of the experiment are identified and reasonable suggestions for improvement are made. \\ \midrule
		B7
		& Is able to identify a pattern in the data
		& No attempt is made to search for a pattern.
		& The pattern described is irrelevant or inconsistent with the data.
		& The pattern has minor errors or omissions. Terms like ``proportional'' used without clarity, e.g.\ is the proportionality linear, quadratic, etc.
		& The pattern represents the relevant trend in the data. When possible, the trend is described in words. \\ \midrule
		B8
		& Is able to represent a pattern mathematically (if applicable)
		& No attempt is made to represent a pattern mathematically.
		& The mathematical expression does not represent the trend.
		& No analysis of how well the expression agrees with the data is included, or some features of the pattern are missing.
		& The expression represents the trend completely and an analysis of how well it agrees with the data is included. \\ \midrule
		B9
		& Is able to devise an explanation for an observed pattern
		& No attempt is made to explain the observed pattern.
		& An explanation is vague, not testable, or contradicts the pattern.
		& An explanation contradicts previous knowledge or the reasoning is flawed.
		& A reasonable explanation is made. It is testable and it explains the observed pattern. \\
