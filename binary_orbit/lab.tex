\chapter{Binary Orbit}

\section{Introduction}

In this lab we will use our observations of the binary star system Cyg 61 to add a data point to historical measurements of its constituent star's positions, which we will then use to estimate the orbital parameters of the binary system, specifically the orbital period $P$ and semi-major axis $a$. These we will combine with Kepler's Third Law of orbital motion to obtain an estimate for the combined mass of the two stars

\section{Learning goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item Gain understanding of celestial coordinate system used in astronomical observation
\item Understand how Kepler's Laws can be used to determine the physical properties of asophysical systems
\item Gain practice graphically representing scientific data and inferring values from those graphs
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduciton to 61 Cygni AB}
One of the questions beguiling humanity for millennia was: how far away are the stars?  Until 1838, no one could tell!  They looked to be almost astoundingly far away, because their parallax, their back-and-forth motion on the sky when the Earth orbits the Sun, was too small to measure.  In fact, stars appearing fixed on the sky was an argument for geocentricism!

Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel made the first measurement of parallax, and thus the distance to a star. Giuseppe Piazzi had tipped him off, discovering in 1804 that the binary star 61 Cygni AB had a high proper motion, and thus was likely close to us. By 1838, Bessel had carried out the precise measurements needed to determine that it is only 10.3 light years away (modern figure, 11.4 light years).  Quickly other investigators measured parallaxes for other stars, including the closest star we know of now, Proxima Centauri (part of the triple system Alpha Centauri, which is in the Southern hemisphere).  See pages 32-33 of the book for this story. 

Last lab we found that the same substances on Earth are also in the heavens (on the surface of the Sun in particular).  Newton’s triumph was to realize the gravitational acceleration pulling on falling objects is the same force that holds the Moon in orbit.  This insight can be generalized further to pairs of stars that orbit around their mutual center-of-mass.  The 61 Cygni binary system has an observable orbit. We have a long baseline of measurements on it partially due to the intense observations to determine its parallax.  We will use these measurements to determine its orbit, and from that, the mass of the system (see pages 56-58 of the book). This measurement serves as an example of how we use dynamical properties of stars to learn about their physical properties. 

\section{Introduction to Keplerian Orbits}
 
Kepler's three laws are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Planetary Orbits are elliptical with the Sun at one focus
\item The line between a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time
\item The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed
\end{enumerate}

These \textit{emperical} (i.e. data-derived) laws were given a physical explaination by Newton. He postulated that a gravitational force proportional to the inverse square of the mutual distance acts between all bodies, and he showed this postulate resulted in Kepler’s three laws. Newton's theory gives the constant of proportionality in Kepler's third law:

\begin{equation}
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M_A + M_B)}a^3
\end{equation}

where $P$ is the orbital period, $G = 6.672 \times 10^{-11} \textrm{m}^3\textrm{kg}^{-1}\textrm{s}^{-2}$ is Newton's Gravitational Constant, $M_A + M_B$ is the sum of the masses of the two orbiting bodies, and $a$ is the \textbf{semi-major axis} of the ellipse swept out by the difference in the positions between bodies A and B. This week we will estimate $P$ and $a$ for 61 Cyg AB from both our contemporary data as well as centuries-old data. Then we will use the above equation to estimate the sum of the masses of the stars. 

\section{The Celestial Coordinate System and Sky Orientation Coordinates}
\section{Assembling the data}
\subsection{Adding a 2018 value to the 61 Cygni AB Observations}

Download your data for 61 Cyg in the same way as you did for the HR diagram lab, except this time use the \texttt{WCS.fits} file. If you do not have one of those in your observation's directory, ask another group to share theirs with you (since everyone took identical observations, this won't change your analysis). Open up the image in DS9. In the top pannel, you should notice coordinates labeled $\alpha$ and $\delta$ --- these are Right Ascention and Declination in the celestial coordinate system. To record both coordinates \textit{in degrees} for the centers of both stars, make a region centereda on your star, double-click to show region info. Right of \texttt{Center} coordinates is a menue. In the last section of that menue, change \texttt{Sexagesimal} to \texttt{Degrees} to get center coordinates in degrees. Record there for both stars.   

The relative orbit depends on the difference in these coordinates, ($\Delta\alpha$, $\Delta\delta$), which are the positions of star B minus the positions of star A. Calculate these values given central coordinates you just obtained, and convert them to \textbf{arcseconds}. There are 60 \textbf{arcminutes} in a degree, and 60 \textbf{arcseconds} in an arcminuite. Note, however, that because of the ``bunching up" of $\alpha$ near the poles (something called a singularity in the spherical coordinate system), we need to multiply $\Delta\alpha$ by $\cos(\delta)$ to obtain a physical value. 

To compare our observation with historical data, we have to convert our differences in the celestial coordinate system to a polar coordinate system definied by separation $r$ and position angle $\theta$:

\begin{equation}
r = \sqrt{\Delta\alpha^2 + \Delta\delta^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\theta = \arctan{\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\Delta\delta}}
\end{equation}

These values (and their errors!) can now be added to the historical data given in Table~\ref{61cyg_data}.(Note: The errors given for 1914 and 1951 were pretty generous, greater than the pixel scale, but limited because the images of the stars were saturated.  The pre-1900 values were given in the literature by other methods, and without an error bar quoted.)

\section{Estimating Orbital Parameters}

A precise and accurate measurement from our data would require fitting the positions of the stars as a function of time for an orbital model including eccentricity and inclination, which is too complicated for this lab. Instead, we can esimate visually the period and orbital semi-major axis by plottig our data. To do this, we must convert our $(r, \theta)$ coordinates to $(x, y)$ coordinates with the following equations:

\begin{equation}
x = r\cos\theta\;\;\;y = r\sin\theta
\end{equation}

To put these in physical uints, divide these values by the measured parallax of the system, 0.314 arcsec, to get coordinates in AU. Plot the data points using the software or coding language of your choice.  Estimate the semi-major axis of the orbit as half the greatest distance between two data points, and the period as twice the difference in time between those same points. Determine an error estimate, which you should explain and record for both quantities.

\section{Deriving the mass of the binary}

Now that we have the orbital period $P$ and semi-major axis $a$ of the binary star system, calculate the combined mass $M_A + M_B$ using Kepler's Third Law, stated at the beginning of the manual. Estimate and report your error on this measurement.
