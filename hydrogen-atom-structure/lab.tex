\chapter{Discovering the Hydrogen Atom}

\section{Learning Goals}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Learn to critically evaluate model of physical phenomena and understand how these models are formulated.
	
	\item Develop methods for testing and working with objects which cannot be directly observed. 
	
	\item Gain an understanding of the atomic model and why it differs from what classical physics predicts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lab Team Roles}

Decide which team members will hold each role this week: facilitator, scribe, technician, skeptic. If there are three members, consider having the skeptic double with another role. Consider taking on a role you are less comfortable with, to gain experience and more comfort in that role.

Additionally, if you are finding the lab roles more restrictive than helpful, you can decide to co-hold some or all roles, or thinking of them more like functions that every team needs to carry out, and then reflecting on how the team executed each function.

\section{Model Evaluation and Construction} %beggingin with these two things, lets see how you can work with these two things

\subsection{Goal} 
When thinking of an atom, we usually tend to imagine a series of electrons orbiting around a nucleus in nice circular orbits. While at first this model might seem unremarkable, the reality is that the physics that describes it is a lot weirder than you think! In order to see why this is, lets see if we can reconstruct the model of the atom qualitatively first. Starting from the assumption that the atom is made up of protons and electrons, over the course of the lab you will create your own model for how these components interact.


\begin{steps} 
	\item First, lets take the classical planetary model of the atom at face value. Using only classical physics concepts, try and find whats wrong with this model. 
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Think first about what happens to satellites orbiting Earth as they interact with the atmosphere. What forces are acting on it? What happens to it over time?
		
		\item Consider that changing the orbital radius of a body requires a corresponding change in energy. Think about the changes in kinetic and potential energy as the satellite moves closer and farther from the Earth. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Once your group has come up with an answer, describe what happens to the orbiting object in terms of its energy and its position over time. What implications does this have when you apply it to the atom?
	
	\item After identifying the problem with the model, develop several ideas for a new model which solves the issues you found. \textbf{Forget any previous knowledge of the atom. Think outside the box.} Write down your ideas and describe how they solve the problem. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item These models don't have to be too complicated, just try thinking of different way in which the electron might move or behave in relation to the nucleus.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{steps}

\section{Observation Experiment: How does an atom absorb and release energy?} %This one should be the assessed experiment. 

\subsubsection{Goal}
Now that you have a rough model of the atom, lets supplement that with some observations to see if you can make it more robust. The difficulty with trying to learn about the structure of the atom is that we have no way of directly observing it. However, we are able to interact with it and observe the results. In this experiment, you will be firing photons at an atom and you will attempt to modify your model based on your observations of the results.

\subsubsection{Steps}

\begin{steps} 
	\item Once in the simulation, make sure to turn on the spectrometer, and familiarize yourself with the tools available. Available to you are photon gun which can be set to white or monochromatic (single color) light, a spectrometer which you can take snapshots of, and a speed toggle.
	
	\item To start, try firing white light at the atom. What patterns do you observe? Record any qualitative observations and describe the pattern. 
	
	\item After you have recorded your observations turn off the light, reset the spectrometer, and switch over to monochromatic light. Try firing light of several different wavelengths (colors) at the atom. Record your observations
	
	\item Now, for each of the wavelengths listed, record what happens when photons at that wavelength are fired at the atom. Describe any patterns you observe and include screenshots of the spectrometer. (Try and pay attention to the order in which the photons are emitted)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Wavelengths to test: 122nm, 103nm, 97nm, 95nm, 94nm 
		
		\item \textbf{Important: Sometimes the simulation might freeze and the atom will appear to no longer emit photons. If that happens, switch over to the white light setting, wait until the atom starts emitting again, switch over to monochromatic light, reset the spectrometer, and continue.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item One thing you might have noticed is that for certain wavelengths, the atom might emit several different colors of light. Why might this be happening? Think about it in terms of the energy being absorbed and emitted by the atom. Does it make sense for the atom to be emitting photons at higher wavelengths than the ones absorbed? Remember that energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the photon (as one increases the other decreases). Why does the atom absorb at some wavelengths and not others? Record your answers to these questions. 
	
	\item Once you believe you have found a pattern, modify your model of the atom so that it is able to explain these new observations. Record any changes you made and describe how these explain the observed patterns.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Think about where the energy goes in the atom once its absorbed
		
		\item Does your atom somehow change following an increase in energy? It might help to think back to the classical orbit analogy used int the previous experiment.   
		
		\item How do you account for the fact that only very specific amounts of energy are absorbed and emitted? 
	\end{itemize}

	\item What does your model predict would happen
\end{steps}

\subsection{The Building Blocks of Everything}
 The word atom finds its roots in the Greek word \textit{atomos} which means indivisible and is believed to have first been used by Democritus to refer to the indivisible spheres which he believed to be the building blocks of our world. Today, we have a far better understanding of the atom and its structure, however, this is information we take for granted. For millennia, there was no clear answer as to what the smallest unit of everything was, and only relatively recently did we develop tools which allowed us to study them more closely. The first comprehensive atomic model was developed in 1803 by John Dalton, who thought of them as solid spheres which changed depending on the element they made up. Then, in 1904, JJ Thompson developed the ``Plum Pudding'' model, which proposed that the atom as made up of electrons floating within a cloud of positive charge. Then in 1911 Ernst Rutherford proposed the nuclear model, where the positive charge was concentrated in the center of the atom. Two years later, Niels Bohr improved upon Thompson's model, suggesting that the orbits were fixed. Finally, Erwin Schrodinger proposed in 1926 the quantum model, where electrons exist around the nucleus in a ``cloud of probability''. You will now have a chance to interact with each of these models.

\subsection{Goal} 
Now that you have developed your own model for what an atom might look like, you will now see the models which at different times were considered the most accurate. You will evaluate each model and try to develop an understanding for the reasoning behind it. 

\subsection{Steps}

\begin{steps}
	\item Make sure the simulation is in ``Prediction'' mode. On the left, you will see a list of all the atomic models organized from ``classical'' to ``quantum''
	
	\item For each model, provide a qualitative description of its structure and behavior. How does it absorb energy? Where does it go once its absorbed? Are there any structural changes? etc. 
	
	\item Along with each description, provide an explanation of the possible reasoning behind each model. What problems does each model address? Why would each model be a good guess as to the structure of an atom. Likewise describe what is wrong with each model. What does it fail to describe or account for?
	
	\item Now compare the model you came up with to some of the other models. Does it resemble any of the other models? Does it improve on some of the shortcomings of the other models? What did you take into account that they did not? Was there anything missing from your model? What did you fail to consider? Write down your observations
	
	\item Along with each description, include a screenshot of the spectrometer for the model. 
	
	\item In the previous experiment, you saw how atoms can only absorb and emit a very specific amount of energy. Provide a rough estimate of the different amounts of energy which the atom is emitting, and if this makes sense given the amount of energy absorbed.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use the equation $\mathit{E} = \mathit{h}\nu$ where $\mathit{E}$ is energy joules, $\mathit{h}$ is planck's constant equal to \newline $6.62 \times 10^{-34}$Js, and $\nu$ is the frequency of the emitted photon in hertz.
		
		\item Since you are given the wavelength, use the equation $\nu = \dfrac{c}{\lambda}$ to find the frequency
		
		\item Make sure to include uncertainties in your calculations.
	\end{itemize}
\end{steps}

\section{Group dynamics}

\begin{steps}
	\item Write a 100--200 word reflection on group dynamics and feedback on the lab manual. Address the following topics: who did what in the lab, how did you work together, what successes and challenges in group functioning did you have, and what would you keep and change about the lab write-up?
	
	\item Write a paragraph reporting back from each of the four roles: facilitator, scribe, technician, skeptic. Where did you see each function happening during this lab, and where did you see gaps?
\end{steps}

\section{Report checklist and grading}

The lab grade consists of 3 points for each of seven scientific ability rubric rows (the 5 listed above, which apply just to that section, as well as F1 and F2, applied to the entire report), and 9 points for providing evidence in the lab report of completing all steps of the lab, including answering every question, for a total of 30 points.
