\chapter{Self-Directed Experiment}

You've spent the last 4 weeks learning various techniques for collecting and analyzing astronomical data. Now it's your turn to choose a project and use those techniques more independently to answer a scientific question that you choose. At least, you can choose from a list, so it is more likely you'll find a project that appeals to you.

So in the next two weeks, you will conduct the experiment / project, and in the following week, you will present your findings in class (as well as submitting a written report). Our goal is for you to work more independently than in past weeks, and also use your TA, professor, and teaching support manager for assistance when needed.

\section{Project A: Use of different wavelengths to see different things}

\section{Project B: When did the Crab Nebula star explode?}

\section{Project C: How heavy is the binary star system 61 Cygni AB?}

\section{Project D: How hot is the Sun?}

\section{Project E: How fast are stars moving and why?}

\section{Project F: Thin/thick disk populations?}
