* Imagine making an accurately scaled model of the Solar System on a 100-yard long football field, with the Sun on one end, and Neptune on the other. Without using a book, or the Internet, or any resource, place and label a dot for your best guess orbital distance for each of the eight planets orbiting the Sun. There are no wrong answers here - this is for you to gauge your current intuition.
-> turn in or something. post it. clearly separate.

* Do something similar for the size of the Sun and the eight planets. Draw a circle to represent each of these objects, proportionately sized.

* Now make another scale model of relative position for the sun, Neptune, our nearest star Proxima Centauri, and its planet, Proxima Centauri b. Again, do not use any resources - this is to capture your current intuition.

* students build scale models
 * solar system sizes - sun, planets
 * solar system distances - sun, planets, Kuiper belt
 * distance from here to next star and solar system extent - sun, neptune, AC, ACb

* parallax example? parsec
  * measuring near thing, vs far thing -> need wider lens

(homework)
* appreciating distances:
 * how long would it take to drive around equator, to sun, from sun to neptune, from sun to proxima centauri?
 * if you wanted to travel each of those distances in 100 years, how fast would you need to go?
 * for the longest distance, how does that speed compare to the speed of light, which is the fastest anything can go? (maybe 1 year?)






* diffraction limit?
 * example for eyes - when does row of lines look like a solid square? What is angular resolution of eyes? What is prediction of diffraction limit?

* walking at light-speed, maybe 10x light-speed, to get feel for it 

 Proxima Centauri b
 * discovered in 2016
 * potentially habitable
